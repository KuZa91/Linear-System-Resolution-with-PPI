# Linear-System-Resolution-with-PPI
This program, will ask to the user for the dimension and the coefficients of a generical linear system of m equation in n variables and will find the best solution for the system by using the Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse.  
The power of the method lies in the fact that the system will be solved regardless of the number of linearly independent equations and variables, i.e also system which doesn't admit any analytical solution will be solved with a certain amount of error, depending on the system in analysis.
Furthermore, all the systems which naturally admits an exact solution will give in output the exact solution of the system, which de facto, naturally behaves as the one that minimize the error.
